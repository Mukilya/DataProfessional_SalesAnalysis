# DataProfessional_SalesAnalysis
This project involves designing an interactive Sales Dashboard to monitor and analyze the performance of a global retail business. Built using Power BI, the dashboard provides real-time insights into key sales metrics, helping stakeholders make data-driven decisions.
The dashboard consolidates sales data across multiple countries, store locations, product categories, and payment methods, and visualizes it using maps, charts, and KPIs.
## Key Features:
**KPIs:** Total Orders, Total Sales, Total Profit, Discounts Given, and Average Order Value.

**Geo Analysis:** Sales by store locations visualized on a world map.

**Time-Based Trends:** Monthly and Daily Sales Trend line/bar charts for time-series insights.

**Category Breakdown:** Sales performance across major product categories (e.g., Home & Kitchen, Electronics, Clothing).

**Payment Method Analysis:** Pie chart breakdown showing Mobile, Credit Card, and Cash contributions.

**Interactive Filters:** Slicers for Country, Store Location, Category, Payment Method, and Date Range.

## Business Insights Uncovered:
Identified peak sales periods in December and weekends (especially Sundays).

Noted high-performing categories like Home & Kitchen and Clothing.

Balanced usage of payment methods indicating flexibility in customer preferences.

Specific cities (New York, London, Lagos) emerged as top-performing store locations.

## Tools & Technologies Used:
**Power BI** (Dashboard Design, DAX Calculations)

**Excel/CSV** (Data Cleaning and Preprocessing)

**Power Query Editor** (Data Transformation)

Map Visuals, Line Charts, Bar Charts, Pie Charts, Cards, Slicers

## Recommendations:

Boost low-performing days (Tuesday/Friday) with discounts or campaigns.

Investigate the "Again" category with 0 sales â€“ possibly a data issue.

Continue leveraging top-performing months (e.g., December) with seasonal offers.

Keep offering diverse payment options, as customers use all modes almost equally.

Explore and expand successful store locations (e.g., New York, London, Lagos).

## Conclusion:
This dashboard reveals a healthy and profitable business, with strong sales distributed across various locations and product categories. The high average order value and profit margin reflect effective pricing and product strategies. However, some areas like June (low monthly sales) and Tuesdays/Fridays (low daily sales) might benefit from targeted promotions.
